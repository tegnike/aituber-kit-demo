## Microphone Input

### Overview

In AITuberKit, in addition to text input, you can also use voice input with a microphone. This feature allows you to enjoy conversations without using a keyboard. Microphone input is especially useful in Realtime API mode and Audio mode.

### Basics of Microphone Input

#### Allowing Microphone Permissions

When using microphone input in AITuberKit for the first time, the browser will display a dialog asking for permission to access the microphone.

1. Select "Allow" when the browser permission dialog appears
2. If you denied permission or want to change the settings later, you can change the settings from the microphone icon near the browser's address bar

#### How to Use Microphone Input

There are two methods for microphone input:

1. **Using keyboard shortcuts**

   - Press and hold the Alt key (Option key on Mac) to accept voice input
   - Release the key when you finish speaking to send the request

2. **Using the microphone button**
   - Click the microphone button at the bottom of the screen to start voice input
   - Click the button again when you finish speaking to send the request
   - You can also set "No Speech Timeout" in Other Settings to automatically stop and send voice input

### Microphone Input Tips

#### Tips for Improving Voice Recognition Accuracy

1. **Speak clearly**

   - Especially for languages like Japanese, speaking clearly improves voice recognition accuracy

2. **Reduce environmental noise**

   - Using in a quiet environment improves recognition accuracy
   - Using a headset or directional microphone can reduce background noise

3. **Speak to the microphone at an appropriate distance**
   - Too close to the microphone can distort the sound, too far can result in insufficient volume
   - Generally, a distance of about 10-15cm from your mouth to the microphone is appropriate

#### Selecting Microphone Equipment

If you have multiple microphone devices, you can select which microphone to use from the browser settings:

1. Open the browser settings screen
2. Look for the Privacy and Security (or equivalent) section
3. In Site Settings > Microphone, you can select connected devices
